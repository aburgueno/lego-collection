## Personal LEGO collection management system

Hi there,

I have been working for a while on a Python 3 application to manage my LEGO collection.

I physically store my +- 60,000 Lego bricks in labelled boxes (+- 275) according to their type. 
As it is the case with rebrickable.com, for each Lego set I own, the application tells me what type of Lego 
bricks I need to build it and how many of each type. In addition (and this is the interesting point), 
the application tells me in which box I store each brick.

As an example, the image below displays one of the html pages generated by the application with the box labels printed in green.

The application uses the rebrickable.com API and the Python packages shelves, pandas and jinja2. If there is some interest out there, I can work a little bit to add some documentation.

I hope this is useful.
